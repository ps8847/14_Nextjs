sometime we need to make or show only demo of some page sof our applictaion  .  we can make a separate build for them in nextjs 

they will be like a html website : 

simply just build yoyur website then go to the next.config.js and add this line there :

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    output:"export"
}

module.exports = nextConfig

 
and just simply run : npm run build


after running that command , tehre wil be "out" folder . on click of that , you can flow the wesbite as html pages
