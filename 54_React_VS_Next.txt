Reactjs -> * a javascript libraray

           * need to add routing and other package 
           * reactjs official website recommend use framework like reactjs

           * just need javascript for start with react 
           * good for small scale app 
           * client-side rendering

NextJs ->  * a reactjs framwork 
            * server side rendering of ui element 
            * many packages are already added in framework 
            * Nextjs is a framework that provide many features 
                1) routing 
                2) server side rendering 
                3) middleware etc
