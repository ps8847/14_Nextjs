* what is dynamic route 
     suppose we want to show the data of 1000 students

     fo roll number 1 the route will be /data/student/10
     fo roll number 2 the route will be /data/student/20
     fo roll number 3 the route will be /data/student/30
        :                                  :
     fo roll number n the route will be /data/student/n   

     will we make the manual routes for each student ? ofcourse not. here we will use dynamic routing
